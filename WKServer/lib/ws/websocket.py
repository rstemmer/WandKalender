    def BeautifyValues(self, packet, affectkey, old, new):
        """
        This method can be used to beautify values inside nested dictionaries.
        Use-cases are replacing Division Slashes by normal slashes or hyphens by n-dashes in song names.

        It recursively scans through nested dictionaries and lists (``packet``) 
        to find a specific key (``affectkey``).
        The content behind that key, in case it is of type string, gets scanned for ``old`` substring.
        This substring then gets replaced by the substirng ``new``

        For easy to read code, the method returns the reference to ``packet``.
        Keep in mind that the content of `packet` will be changed even if the return value gets not assigned.

        The core algorithm was copied from `sotapme @ stackoverflow <https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14882138/replace-value-in-json-file-for-key-which-can-be-nested-by-n-levels/14882688>`:

        Further more the state of the connection gets checked.
        If the connection state is not *OPEN*, ``False`` gets returned, too.

        All values behind the ``name`` key of the packet get beautified.
        It is assumed that those values are used to display information to the user.
