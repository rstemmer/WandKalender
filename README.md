# Wand Kalender

This is an **experimental** CalDAV client.
So for now this project is not really useful.
It may become in future, and then I will a more details about it.

## Background Story

I built this project for my parents to provide an easy accessible (read-only) calendar for the kitchen.
Goal of this project is to replace classical wall-mounted family calendars.

The Front-End is loaded by a Raspberry Pi that directly boots into Firefox and loads the WandKalender2 web front-end.
The Raspberry Pi is powered by USB-Ports of a vertical oriented FullHD screen.
Mounting the Pi behind the monitor leads then to a setup that requires only one visible cable (Screen-Power-Connector).

## Future Plans 

The setup for the Raspberry Pi will be provided in future.
Additional to further documentation some photos and screenshots will be uploaded in future.
